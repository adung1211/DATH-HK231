# Summary

Implemented a basic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) module from scratch using the NeMo toolkit for educational purposes, leveraging the 100-hour LibriSpeech training dataset. The project includes a report in Vietnamese detailing its progress and findings.

The setup involved creating a manifest file and uploading it to Google Drive, configuring the checkpoint manager for fully cloud-based training.
